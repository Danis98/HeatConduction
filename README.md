# HeatConduction
Simulated heat conduction in 2D, by numerically solving the heat transfer equation.

The equation is a second degree differential equation with three variables (x, y, t), and is described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation.

The simulation is initialized by loading the image "MFF.png". Red areas are heat sources, as well as the borders.
